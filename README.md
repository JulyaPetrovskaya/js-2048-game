Project Name  
### ðŸ§© **2048 Game**  - [DEMO LINK](https://JulyaPetrovskaya.github.io/js-2048-game)
&nbsp; _Description_: 

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic 2048 game. The game features a 4x4 grid where players combine numbered tiles by sliding them with arrow keys, aiming to reach the 2048 tile. It includes core game mechanics such as tile merging, random tile generation, score tracking, and game over/win states. The project showcases skills in JavaScript game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.  

#### Main Technologies and Frameworks:
- JavaScript (ES6+) â€” core game logic and event handling
- ESLint â€” code linting for error checking and maintaining consistent style
- HTML5 â€” game board markup
- SCSS (Sass) â€” preprocessor for writing and organizing styles efficiently
- CSS3 â€” styles for rendering the interface in the browser (compiled from SCSS)
- DOM API â€” manipulating page elements and updating game state
- Event Listeners â€” handling key presses for game control
- Node.js â€” JavaScript runtime environment for development and running the project
- npm â€” package manager for dependency installation and script management
- Git â€” version control system
